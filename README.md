# Regression
This repository contains data and code for the post-processing of simulation output (daylight or noise). The post-processing is focused on identifying correlation patterns between dependent and independent variables using various methods (i.a., regression analysis & Pearson's correlation).

The repository is organized to the following folders:

- data: contains the datasets used in the Jupyter notebooks
- img: contains the image files used in the Jupuyter notebooks

and includes a Jupyter notebook where regression and Pearson correlation analyses are performed over the generated obstruction angle simulation output for existing buildings and vegetation in the Bellevue neighbourhood, Malm√∂, southern Sweden.
